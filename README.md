### motivation paragraphs 
I am very excited to learn Git, R and VS Code this year. To be fair, it's not easy for me to understand and use these services but I learn very fast ! Learning to use these tools allows me to develop my hard skills and to build a real toolbox for supporting athletes ! I am realy looking forward for this year !
